      "solutionTitle": "Guided onboarding, proactive retention.",

      "challengeTitle": "Producing content at scale was impossible.",
      "challengeP1": "An active Meta brand needs 20 to 50 new creatives per month just to avoid ad fatigue. That means hiring photographers, designers, and videographers — and still falling behind the competition.",
      "challengeP2": "On top of that, there was no way to know what competitors were doing. Content decisions were made blind, without data, and ad spend was optimized manually once a week — often too late.",
      "solutionTitle": "Loop: generation, intelligence, and publishing in one place.",
      "solutionP1": "We built Loop as an end-to-end platform. From the web, brands generate product photos from multiple angles, Pixar-style 3D renders, and e-commerce videos — no photo shoots, no studios, no waiting. In minutes.",
      "solutionP2": "Loop is also integrated with Meta Ad Library to discover and analyze any competitor's ads. An AI agent works 24 hours a day analyzing which creatives are performing, detecting patterns, and generating new content from those recommendations. Everything is automatically published to organic accounts and paid Meta campaigns.",
      "resultsTitle": "Unlimited content. Data-driven decisions.",
      "resultsP1": "Brands using Loop go from producing 5-10 pieces per week to generating 500+ creatives per month — at a production cost 80% lower than a traditional photo shoot. The time previously spent coordinating production is now invested in strategy.",
      "resultsP2": "The AI agent closes the loop: it analyzes the performance of every ad, identifies what's working for competitors, and autonomously generates the next batch of content. Marketing teams stop putting out fires and start scaling.",
      "testimonialQuote": "Loop completely changed how we think about content. We no longer depend on an agency or photo shoots. We have new creatives every week, and the agent tells us exactly what's working.",

      "challengeP1": "Event space marketplaces have historically relied on word of mouth. Paid traffic in this niche is expensive and hard to scale. SpacePal needed to build an organic traffic engine that could work without a constant advertising budget.",
      "challengeP2": "On top of that, emerging channels like LLMs (ChatGPT, Perplexity) were capturing more and more high-intent searches — and no competitor was positioned there yet. It was a window of opportunity that needed to be seized before it closed.",
      "solutionTitle": "Programmatic SEO, LLMs, and TikTok: three engines running in parallel.",
      "solutionP1": "We built a programmatic SEO system that automatically generates and updates landing pages for every city, space type, and event type. Pages were scraped weekly to incorporate ranking changes and market updates — covering everything from photography studios in Buenos Aires to event halls in Mendoza.",
      "solutionP2": "In parallel, we executed an LLM presence strategy: identified the most frequently asked questions in the niche on Reddit, engaged in key threads, and built topical authority so SpacePal would appear in ChatGPT and Perplexity answers. This was complemented by TikTok multi-accounts in carousel format — tips on event organization, how to find venues, location management — organically and indirectly redirecting audience to the platform.",
      "resultsTitle": "A traffic engine that works 24/7.",
      "resultsP1": "50% of SpacePal's total traffic today comes from SEO. The programmatic landing pages cover dozens of cities and categories, attracting high-intent traffic at the exact moment of decision. Content updates itself, with no manual intervention.",
      "resultsP2": "SpacePal appears in LLM responses for key niche queries — a distribution channel that most competitors still ignore. The multi-channel TikTok generates cold audiences that convert into direct traffic weeks later, closing the funnel organically.",
      "testimonialQuote": "We had the product. The problem was nobody could find us. Today 50% of traffic arrives on its own, without us doing anything. The system works while we sleep.",
